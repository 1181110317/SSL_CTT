> **Abstract.** Convolutional neural networks can achieve remarkable performance in semantic segmentation tasks. However, such neural network approaches heavily rely on costly pixel-level annotation. Semi-supervised learning is a promising resolution to tackle this issue, but its performance still far falls behind the fully supervised counterpart. This work proposes a cross-teacher training framework with three modules that significantly improves traditional semi-supervised learning approaches. The core is a cross-teacher module, which could simultaneously **reduce the coupling among peer networks and the error accumulation between teacher and student networks**. In addition, we propose two complementary contrastive learning modules. The high-level module can transfer high-quality knowledge from labeled data to unlabeled ones and promote separation between classes in feature space. The low-level module can encourage low-quality features learning from the high-quality features among peer networks. In experiments, the cross-teacher module significantly improves the performance of traditional studentâ€“teacher approaches, and our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
